Sink or be sunk.

**You are the blue player.**

You can invade an enemy territory or reinforce land you own by clicking one of your regions, then a neighboring region. One unit will stay behind to defend the region.

Regions that have sent units somewhere become unavailable for the duration of the turn.

You gain faith every turn which you can spend on cards.

Each turn, units of every owned region will increase by the number of tiles that make up that region (a region of 3 tiles will increase by 3 units each turn, before modifiers).

Craft a deck comprised of cards that synergize to progress in the map, as random modifiers will stack up the odds against you.
