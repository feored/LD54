playtest with slow game:
    * ramp up tile disappearing
    * option to merge regions for faster travel
    * game was more fun when it was faster imo

playtest with fast game and lots of tiles sinking:
    * promising but needs to be VERY aggressive to have an effect - 10+
    * better if very fast then slow down as we go
    * games with just 2-3 teams are not very fun

general ideas:
    * bonuses on tiles for protecting against sinking, or boost unit generation
    * neutral tiles that spawn with defenders can give you items to use on your tiles regions with said bonuses, or on ennemy tiles for attack!
    * dumb bot to move units around when region is landlocked by other owned regions
    * new bot with greedy pathfinding algorithm that focuses on tiles randomly
