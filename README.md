**You are the blue player.**

You can invade an enemy territory or reinforce land you own by clicking one of your regions, then a neighboring region. One unit will stay behind to defend the region.

Regions that have sent units somewhere become unavailable for the duration of the turn.

You can also sacrifice your own tiles to Neptune's glory. This will increase your sacrifice counter by one, which you can then use to sink an enemy's tile. You can only sacrifice or sink one tile per turn.

Each turn, units of every owned region will increase by the number of tiles that make up that region.

Click "End turn" to pass, press escape for a pause menu and to go back to the main menu.
