# LD54 - Neptune's Wake

Sink or be sunk.

Strategically dispatch your units to acquire more territory, reinforce lands at risk of invasion or sacrifice parts of your empire for Neptune's glory !




## How to play:

**You are the blue player.**

You can invade an enemy territory or reinforce land you own by clicking one of your regions, then a neighboring region. One unit will stay behind to defend the region.

Regions that have sent units somewhere become unavailable for the duration of the turn.

You can also sacrifice your own tiles to Neptune's glory. This will increase your sacrifice counter by one, which you can then use to sink an enemy's tile. You can only sacrifice or sink one tile per turn.

Each turn, units of every owned region will increase by that region's size.

Click "End turn" to pass, press escape for a pause menu and to go back to the main menu.
